This is the code for [www.xyfir.com](https://www.xyfir.com), a portal for the Xyfir Network and a catch-all for things that don't fit anywhere else or that are too small to be given their own domain/server/etc.

In order to get this running you'll need to create a copy of `config.default.js`, name that copy `config.js`, and then fill in the values. Next, do the same thing for `client/constants/config.default.json`. Afterwards you'll need to run `npm install`, `npm run build`, and finally `node app` to launch the server.

Fixes, additions, or general improvements are welcome.
