This is the code for https://xyfir.com.

In order to get this running you'll need to create a copy of `config.default.js`, name that copy `config.js`, and then fill in the values. Next, do the same thing for `client/constants/config.default.json`. Afterwards you'll need to run `npm install`, `gulp css favicons`, `npm run wp`, and finally `node app` to launch the server.

Fixes, additions, or general improvements are welcome.
